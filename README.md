# LiveWhisper

### Psuedo-live speech transcription
Uses OpenAI's Whisper model, and sounddevice library to listen to microphone.
This project outputs nearly-live, sentence-by-sentence dictation of speech to the terminal.

I've also included my WIP voice-command assistant, based on the same *live* input.
It's just my attempt to create a basic voice assistant like Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Jarvis, etc.
